# quiz-app

This is a simple quiz application developed in Clojure.

Actually, this is a clojure version from https://github.com/rodrigobranas/eda_fullcycle

The main idea is:

    Quiz Online

        Fill the quiz with a name, e-amil and the answers
        Fix the quiz and calculate the grade
        Notify the user sending an e-mail with the grade



## Installation

Download from https://github.com/quiz/quiz-app

## Usage

For the time being, you can just run the tests.

Run the project's tests:

    $ clojure -T:build test

Run that uberjar:

    $ java -jar target/quiz-app-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar


### Bugs

For the time being, I suppose there isn't any bug. For the other side, probably could have some bad smell or architecture issues.
